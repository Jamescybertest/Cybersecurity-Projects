# üîç Nmap Reconnaissance Project

This repository contains a series of reconnaissance tasks performed using Nmap, covering a wide range of scanning techniques commonly used in cybersecurity assessments. These tasks simulate real-world scenarios that security analysts and penetration testers face when assessing network infrastructure.

Each task includes:
- The purpose of the scan
- The exact Nmap command used
- A summary of scan results
- An explanation of what each result means
- The real-world value of the technique

## Real-World Skills Gained

By completing this project, I have developed hands-on experience with **network reconnaissance and port scanning techniques** that are essential for real-world cybersecurity roles. Specifically, I‚Äôve learned how to:

- Perform stealthy and evasive scans to avoid detection
- Enumerate services and detect vulnerabilities based on version info
- Identify exposed ports, misconfigurations, and firewall behavior
- Interpret scan results to support vulnerability assessment and mitigation
- Use reconnaissance data as a foundation for red team or blue team operations

### Why This Skill Is Important

In professional cybersecurity roles ‚Äî especially in **SOC analysis**, **penetration testing**, and **vulnerability assessment** ‚Äî reconnaissance is the **first phase of any security evaluation**. Without accurate mapping of hosts and services, identifying true security gaps becomes difficult.
